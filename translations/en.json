    "about": " This is a simple app that allows you to create a room and pick movies with your friends. You can create a room and invite your friends to join you. You can also join a room by entering the room code. You can then add movies to the room and watch them together. App uses The Movie Database API to get the movies and JustWatch API to get the availabilities.",
    "security": " None of the data is stored on the server. The room is created in memory and is destroyed when the last user leaves the room. No additional data is stored on the server. The room code is generated randomly and the fav movies are stored locally in storage. Currently the backend is hosted in Europe so there might be some slower response times for users outside of Europe. The app is still in development and more features will be added in the future. I dont profit anything from this app and it is made for educational purposes."
